        Competitive programming (CP) is a mental sport where participants compete by solving programming problems under specific time and memory constraints.
        The contests mainly combines two topics: (1) Design of algorithms (2) Implementation of algorithms.
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVKHRtafgPc" target="_blank">This</a> video by William Lin gives a very good overview to intro to CP.

        This guide will mainly contain pseudo code that resembles C++ as it is the programming language of choice. You can use python, java, other languages to 
        attempt the problems given in this guide too. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp" target="_blank">Here</a> is a guide to download
        and set up C++ and VScode (IDE) on your local machine.
    </p>
    <h2>Basic C++</h2>
    <p>Example of a typical C++ template:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            #include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;
            using namespace std;
            int main() {
                ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
                cin.tie(0);
                // solution comes here
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>The first two lines in main make input and output more efficient.</p>
    <p>The #include line at the beginning is for including standard c++ libraries. &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt; is a library
        that contains all necessary functions that you will use in CP. It is used by all competitive programmers that use C++. </p>
    <p>Chapter 2 and 3 of <a href="https://darrenyao.com/usacobook/cpp.pdf" target="_blank">this book</a> explains input, output and time complexities in detail.</p>
    <h2>Important Macros and TypeDefs</h2>
    <p>Macros: are a feature of C++ that allow text substitution before complilation process <br />
    Typedefs: are used to create alias for an existing data type. It <Strong>does not</Strong> create a new datatype.</p>
    <p>Macros and typedefs significantly speed up the speed at which you can write your code and should be a part of your template. Following basic macros and 
        typedefs are used by us:
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            #define rep(i,a,b) for (int i = int(a); i &lt; int(b); i++)
            #define ff first
            #define ss second
            #define yes cout&lt;&lt;"YES\n";
            #define no cout&lt;&lt;"NO\n";
            #define sqr(a) ((a)*(a))
            #define pb push_back
            typedef vector&lt;long long&gt; vi;
            typedef pair&lt;long long, long long&gt; pi;
            typedef long long ll;
            const int inf = 1e9;
            const int llinf = 4e18;

        </code>

    <h2>Output Formating</h2>
    <p>Many times in a contest you will be required to output numbers uptill a specific decimal
    places. For example, if you are required to output a number upto 6 decimal places, you can use the following code:</p>
    </p>
    <p>
        In competitive programming contests, you may often need to format numbers to a specific number of decimal places. For instance, if you are required to output a number up to 6 decimal places
        or output till n significant digits. For this we introduce <code>setprecision</code>.
        <br />
        For giving output with a specific number of decimal places, you can use the following code: <br />
        <code>cout &lt;&lt; fixed &lt;&lt; setprecision(6) &lt;&lt; x;</code> (code for outputting a number x with 6 decimal places) <br \>
        <code>cout &lt;&lt; setprecision(3) &lt;&lt; x;</code> (code for outputting a number with 3 significant digits)
    </p>
    <p>
        It's important to understand the difference between <code>cin</code> and <code>getline</code> in C++:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
        <code>cin</code> stops reading input at the first whitespace character (such as a space <code>' '</code> or newline <code>'\n'</code>). It also <strong>leaves the whitespace character</strong> (like <code>'\n'</code>) in the input stream, which can cause issues if not handled properly.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>getline</code>, on the other hand, reads input until it encounters a newline character <code>'\n'</code>. It <strong>consumes and removes the newline</strong> from the input stream, allowing you to safely read full lines of text, including spaces.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Generally, this behavior is not a problem. However, when using <code>getline</code> after <code>cin</code>, 
        <code>cin</code> leaves the <code>'\n'</code> character in the input stream. 
        As a result, <code>getline</code> interprets it as an empty line. 
        To avoid this, we use <code>cin.ignore()</code> to remove the leftover <code>'\n'</code> before calling <code>getline()</code>.
