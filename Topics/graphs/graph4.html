    <h2>Disjoint Set Union (DSU)</h2>

    <p>
        Disjoint sets are sets that do not share any elements. They are commonly used in algorithms to keep track of 
        connected components in a graph or to determine if two elements belong to the same set efficiently.
        The basic idea behind DSU is to ensure that each set is represented by only one unique item, often called the "representative" or "leader" of the set. 
        This is achieved using two main operations:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Find:</strong> Determines the representative of the set containing a particular element.</li>
        <li><strong>Union:</strong> Merges two sets into one by connecting their representatives.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To perform DSU, we store two indices:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Parent element:</strong> Initially, every element is its own parent, so <code>p[i] = i</code>.
            If item <code>i</code> is the representative of the set containing element <code>j</code>, then <code>p[j] = i</code>.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Rank of each tree:</strong> Helps keep the height of the tree shorter. Initially, all 
            nodes have a rank of 0, which changes as we join nodes. This will be implemented later in union operation.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Find Set Operation</h3>
    <p>
        The <strong>Find</strong> operation returns the representative element of a set. It uses path compression to 
        set the parent element of a disjoint set to a distinct parent value. If two elements have the same index, 
        they belong to the same set.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
        // Find which set an element belongs to
        int findset(int index) {
            if (parent[index] == index) return index;
            return parent[index] = findset(parent[index]); // Path compression
        }
    </code></pre>
    <h3>Union Set Operation</h3>
    <p>
        This operation is used to merge two disjoint sets into one. unionset(i, j) will cause set with element i
        and set with element j to merge. To make resulting tree as short as possible, we now use the information contained
        in rank vector, and ensure that rank[parent of i] &lt;= rank[parent of j] and merge i into j.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
        void unionset(int i, int j){
            if(findset(i) == findset(j)) return;
            int x = findset(i), y = findset(j);
            if(x > y)
            {
                swap(x,y);
            }
            p[x] = y;
            if(rank[x] == rank[y]) rank[y]++;
        }
    </code></pre>
