    <h2>Bridges</h2>
    <!--TODO: add a picture-->
    <p>
        A bridge is an edge in graph on whose removal, the graph split into multiple components. We need to detect which edge is
        a bridge. It is done by maintaining 2 vectors:
        <ul>
            <li>dfs_num[n]: stores the iteration count, when the vertex u is visited for the first time.</li>
            <li>dfs_low[n]: is initially equal to dfs_num, stores the least value of node that can be reached using a 
                "back edge".
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Articulation points</h2>
    <!--TODO: add a picture-->
    <p>Atriculation point is a point on whose removal, the graph breaks into multiple components.</p>
