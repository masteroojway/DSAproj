        Graphs are data structures consisting of nodes (also called vertices) and edges. 
        They are used to model and solve problems involving objects and the relationships between them.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Terminology</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Path and Cycle</h3>
            <p>Path is a sequence of distinct vertices between node a and b. A path is called
                 cycle if the first and last node is the same. Example:
            </p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Components of graph</h3>
            <p>The connected parts of a graph are called its components. If a graph has only one component, it is called <strong>a connected graph</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Graph representations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Adjacency List</h3>
            <p>
                In a graph, every node <code>X</code> is associated with an adjacency list that contains all nodes it is directly connected to (i.e., its neighbors). 
                For a directed graph, an edge from node <code>u</code> to node <code>v</code> is represented by adding <code>v</code> to the adjacency list of <code>u</code>.
                Here's an example:
            </p>
            <pre>
            <code>
                    vector&lt;int&gt; adj[N]; // N is the number of nodes

                    adj[1].push_back(2); // Edge from 1 to 2
                    adj[2].push_back(3); // Edge from 2 to 3
                    adj[2].push_back(4); // Edge from 2 to 4
            </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                For undirected graph => adjacency list will be in both directions [i] = {j} and [j] = {i}. For weighted edges, we can use the following:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    vector&lt;pair&lt;int, int&gt;&gt; adj[N]; // N is the number of nodes
    
                    adj[1].push_back({2,5}); // Edge from 1 to 2 of weight 5
                    adj[2].push_back({3,6}); // Edge from 2 to 3 of weight 6
                    adj[2].push_back({4,1}); // Edge from 2 to 4 of weight 1
                </code>
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Adjacency Matrix</h3>
            <p>
                stores which nodes have edges between them in form of a matrix.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    int adj[N][N];
                    adj[2][3] = 5; //Edge from 2 to 3 of weight 5
                    adj[6][2] = 3; //Edge from 6 to 2 of weight 3
                </code>
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Edge list</h3>
            <p>
                Stores edges in the form of pair of numbers representing nodes. Example:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    vector&lt;pair&lt;int, int&gt;&gt; edges;
                    edges.push_back({2,3});// edge between 2 and 3 nodes
                    edges.push_back({3,4});// edge between 3 and 4 nodes
                    edges.push_back({4,1});// edge between 4 and 1 nodes
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                If the nodes are weighted then we can expand pair to tuple and store weight in the last index. Example:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    vector&lt;tuple&lt;int, int, int&gt;&gt; edges;
                </code>
            </pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>What happens when vertex labels are not labelled from 0 to n-1 or label is not 
        a number all toghether??, Suppose labels are strings, then we can use a map to store the index of each vertex.
        Example: unordered_map&lt;string, vector&lt;string&gt;&gt; adj;
