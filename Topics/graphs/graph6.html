    <h2>Minimum Spanning Tree</h2>
    <p>
        A spanning tree is a tree that contains N vertices and N-1 edges, where every vertex
        is connected to every other vertex. A minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree with the minimum
        sum of edge weights.

    <p>In the example above, we remove the edge between C and A, as its removal does not disconnect the graphâ€”meaning all components remain connected.
        To find a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), we typically use Kruskal's Algorithm or Prim's Algorithm.</p>
