    <h2>Brute Force</h2>
    <p>
        is also known as Complete Search. It is a method that involves traversing the search space entirely.
        One of the ways to optimize brute force is by pruning and traversing relavant parts of the search space.
        It might be unoptimized but a bug free complete search will never give a wrong answer verdict as it explores the
        entire search space. Brute is learnt best by practicing. <a href="https://codeforces.com/" target="_blank">Codeforces</a>
        divisions usually have atleast 1 brute force easy and 1 medium level brute force question every contest (div2 and 3).
        However there are some techniques and patterns discussed below that help in applying these techniques:

    <h3>Permutations of an Array/String</h3>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
        To generate all permutations of an array, we use recursion to fix each index and backtracking
        to explore all configurations by restoring the original state after each recursive call.
    </p>
    <p>
        At each recursive step, we place each remaining element at the current index, generate all permutations
        for the rest, and then backtrack (swap back) to restore the array for the next iteration.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
        nums = {0,1,2 ....};
        void permutations(int index, vi &nums){
            if(index == n)
            {
                //process this permutation ...
                return;
            }
            for(int i = index; i < n;i++)
            {
                swap(nums[i], nums[index]);
                permutation(index+1, nums);
                swap(nums[i], nums[index]); // backtracking
            }
        }
    </code></pre>
    <h3>Josephus Problem</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCsD3ZGzMgE" target="_blank">This Numberphile video</a> on 
    josephus problem when you have to kill alternate people explain very well how you should approach a problem.
    Similarly try to see what would happen if every kth person was killed and not every 2nd person.</p>
