        <h2>Meet in the middle DP</h2>
        <p>is demonstrated very well by <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-into-two-arrays-to-minimize-sum-difference/description/" target="_blank">
            this Leetcode problem.</a></p>
        <p>The intuition of this problem is that it needs to be divided into two subarrays of sum1, sum2 such that sum1+sum2 = total and sum1 is as close as 
            possible to sum2. For this we need to try all possible divisions of subarray. This DP comes under the 2nd category on DP problems (Trying all possible solutions).
