        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful problem-solving technique used in computer science to solve complex problems
          by breaking them down into simpler, overlapping subproblems. It is primarily an optimization over plain recursion,
          where previously computed results are reused to avoid redundant computations.

          Dynamic Programming is commonly used for:
          <ol>
            <li>Finding the optimal solution to a problem (e.g., minimum/maximum value, longest path, etc.)</li>
            <li>Counting the total number of possible solutions (e.g., number of ways to reach a target)</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

      <p>The best way to do DP is understanding the intuition behind it via multiple examples like :</p>

        </h3>
        <p>
          Given a target sum <code>n</code>, you need to compute the total number of distinct sequences of dice rolls (each roll giving 1 to 6) that sum up to exactly <code>n</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a classic Dynamic Programming problem where the recurrence relation is:
        </p>
        <pre><code>f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + f(n-3) + f(n-4) + f(n-5) + f(n-6)</code></pre>
        <p>
          With the base case:
          <br>
          <code>f(0) = 1</code> â€” there's one way to make a sum of 0 (by doing nothing).
        </p>
        <p>
          For all negative values of <code>n</code>, we return 0, since it's not possible to reach negative sums with positive dice rolls.
