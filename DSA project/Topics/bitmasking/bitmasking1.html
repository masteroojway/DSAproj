    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>All data in computer programs is internally stored as bits, i.e., as numbers 0
        and 1. Bitmasking/Bitmanipulation involves directly working with individual bits (0s and 1s)
        using operations like AND, OR, XOR, and NOT : </p>

    <h3>AND operation</h3>
    <p>The and operation x & y produces a number that has one bits in positions where
        both x and y have one bits. For example, 22 & 26 = 18, because</p>
    <h3>OR operation</h3>
    <p>The or operation x | y produces a number that has one bits in positions where at
        least one of x and y have one bits.</p>
    <h3>XOR operation</h3>
    <p>The xor operation x ^ y produces a number that has one bits in positions where
        exactly one of x and y have one bits.</p>
    <h3>NOT operation</h3>
    <p>The not operation ~x produces a number where all the bits of x have been
        inverted. NOT in bitmasking is a tricky operator as its representation depends on size of data structure</p>
        <pre><code>
            x = 29 => 00000000000000000000000000011101
            ~x = âˆ’30 => 11111111111111111111111111100010
        </code></pre>
    <h3>Bit Shift Operations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>x &lt;&lt; k</code>: Shifts the bits of <code>x</code> to the left by <code>k</code> positions (equivalent to multiplying by 2<sup>k</sup>)</li>
        <li><code>x &gt;&gt; k</code>: Shifts the bits of <code>x</code> to the right by <code>k</code> positions (equivalent to dividing by 2<sup>k</sup>, discarding remainder)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>C++ STL</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>__builtin_clz(x): he number of zeros at the beginning of the number (From MSB).</li>
        <li>__builtin_ctz(x): the number of zeros at the end of the number (From LSB).</li>
        <li>_builtin_popcount(x): the number of ones in the number</li>
    </ul>
