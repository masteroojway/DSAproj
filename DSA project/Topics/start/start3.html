    <h1>Intro to competitive programming - 3</h1>
    <h2>Covered in this section: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Priority Queue and it's STL</li>
        <li>Hashing, and STL</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Priority Queue</h2>
    <p>It is a special type of queue in which each element is associated with a priority and is served 
        according to its priority. Its is based on binary heap (will be dealt with later).
    </p>
    <code>priority_queue&lt;Type, cont, cmp&gt;</code>
    <ul>
        <li>Type: decribes the type of data structure present inside priority_queue, like int or ll or pair.</li>
        <li>cont: tells us what is the underlying container of queue, defaults to vector if not mentioned.</li>
        <li>
            <p>comp: When you need to sort based on certain properties, we use comparative functions
                with two arguements a and b. It returns true if a is supposed to be before b in a vector. example: (Comparator to sort with respect to absolute value)
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    bool cmp(int a, int b)
                    {
                        return abs(a) >= abs(b);
                    }
        
                    sort(v.begin(), v.end(), cmp);
                </code>
            </pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>C++ STL for priority queue</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>push()</code>: push element into the queue.</li>
        <li><code>pop()</code>: delete the greatedt element in the queue.</li>
        <li><code>top()</code>: obtain the greatest element of queue.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important time complexities for priority queue</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Insert: O(1)</li>
        <li>Get Highest Priority (e.g., Max/Min): O(n)</li>
        <li>Remove Highest Priority: O(n)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Hash table</h2>
    <p>Hashing means associating a value with a key/index.</p>
    <p>Hash tables are a type of data structure in which the key/index value of the data element is generated from a hash function. 
        This enables very fast data access as the index value behaves as a key for the data value.
     <a href="https://visualgo.net/en/hashtable" target="_blank">This website</a> shows a visualisation
     of hashing with seperate chaining.</p>
    <p>In C++ hashing is used by unordered_map/unordered_set. Normal Map and set will be discussed later.</p>
