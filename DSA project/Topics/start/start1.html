        Competitive programming (CP) is a mental sport where participants compete by solving programming problems under specific time and memory constraints.
        The contests mainly combines two topics: (1) Design of algorithms (2) Implementation of algorithms.
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVKHRtafgPc" target="_blank">This</a> video by William Lin gives a very good overview to intro to CP.

        This guide will mainly contain pseudo code that resembles C++ as it is the programming language of choice. You can use python, java, other languages to 
        attempt the problems given in this guide too. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp" target="_blank">Here</a> is a guide to download
        and set up C++ and VScode (IDE) on your local machine.
    </p>
    <h2>Basic C++</h2>
    <p>Example of a typical C++ template:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            #include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;
            using namespace std;
            int main() {
                ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
                cin.tie(0);
                // solution comes here
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>The first two lines in main make input and output more efficient.</p>
    <p>The #include line at the beginning is for including standard c++ libraries. &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt; is a library
        that contains all necessary functions that you will use in CP. It is used by all competitive programmers that use C++. </p>
    <p>Chapter 2 and 3 of <a href="https://darrenyao.com/usacobook/cpp.pdf" target="_blank">this book</a> explains input, output and time complexities in detail.</p>
    <h2>Important Macros and TypeDefs</h2>
    <p>Macros: are a feature of C++ that allow text substitution before complilation process <br />
    Typedefs: are used to create alias for an existing data type. It <Strong>does not</Strong> create a new datatype.</p>
    <p>Macros and typedefs significantly speed up the speed at which you can write your code and should be a part of your template. Following basic macros and 
        typedefs are used by us:
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            #define rep(i,a,b) for (int i = int(a); i &lt; int(b); i++)
            #define ff first
            #define ss second
            #define yes cout&lt;&lt;"YES\n";
            #define no cout&lt;&lt;"NO\n";
            #define sqr(a) ((a)*(a))
            #define pb push_back
            typedef vector&lt;long long&gt; vi;
            typedef pair&lt;long long, long long&gt; pi;
            typedef long long ll;
            const int inf = 1e9;
            const int llinf = 4e18;
